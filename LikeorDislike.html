    <h1>Dislike</h1>

    <h3>CS-GO</h3>

    <p><strong>It seems to me that there is a lot of negativity around CS:GO, <br>
         mostly with the older players that played 1.6 and source. <br>
         I constantly see on forums that CS:GO is "Broken" and sure, <br>
          I'll admit that it is not perfect but I don't think that it deserves the hate and negativity that the community portrays it to be. <br>
           This game has come a long way since its release, and while it may not be perfect, it is still a great game. <br>

        When I started playing CS:GO, I went about it as if it was a new game; Re-learning the sprays for each gun, the movement, etc. etc. <br>
         My theory is that all these old players put so much work into the older Counter Strike games that they automatically expect to be good at the new one. <br>
          I understand where they're coming from if that's the case. <br>
           Who wants to be crushed by a new player at a game that they have been playing for over 10 years? <br>
        Am I completely wrong or is CS:GO really that broken?</strong></p>
          
        <h3>FORTNITE</h3>
        
        <p> <strong>Fortnite is one of those rare games that offers addictive gameplay, <br>
           well-designed world and a unique experience no other Battle Royale game has to offer, <br>
            not to mention being free to play. It is commonly regarded as a genuine cultural phenomenon and has amassed a player base of a whopping 125 million players, <br>
             a number which has been increasing rapidly since the last few months. <br>
              Despite all of this, the game has several flaws, which differ in each player’s eyes, <br>
               and if not fixed, will cause the player base to decrease rapidly. <br>

            However, when people say that the game is dying, <br>
             they mean that it is in a regressive state, <br>
              not like other games which have rapidly lost their player base in a matter of months.</strong></p>
           
              <h3>WARZONE</h3>

              <p><strong>With Call of Duty: Warzone garnering millions of players since its debut last month, <br>
                 it seems a number of the game's biggest issues are beginning to become frustrating for persistent players. <br>
                  Not only has the game been criticized in the past for its severe issues with hackers, <br>
                   but it has also been called out for its overpowered vehicles, large number of camping locations, and small number of debilitating glitches. <br>

                However, it seems Twitch mainstay Dr DisRespect has another major complaint about the game, <br>
                 with the streamer recently ranting on his broadcast about the game's severe audio problems.</strong></p>

                 <h3>COD MOBILE</h3>

                 <p><strong>If you've just started playing you're probably wondering why is Call of Duty Mobile so easy? The bad news is it's probably not because you're good. <br>
                  Sorry, truth hurts. The game is incredibly easy at the start and you'll find yourself winning games basically all the time and hardly ever dying. <br>
                  If you want to know why then this is where we explain [melodramatic TV voice] the shocking truth about what's going on on Call of Duty Mobile.</strong></p> 

                  <h3>PUBG MOBILE</h3>

                  <p><strong>in PUBG Mobile are populated with its fair share of bots (often dressed in red shirts). <br>
                     While this may kill your satisfaction in a battle royale game, <br>
                     it’s a good way for newer players to test their weapons and learn about the game. <br>
                     Just be careful about boasting your victories if you got them from defeating bots.</strong></p>

                     <h3>ROCKET LAGUE</h3>

                     <p><strong>Some Rocket League players are just the worst. <br>
                         I am sorry. The absolute worst. <br>
                        I’ve been playing solid for the last couple of months and I’ve been making a mental list from day one: <br>
                         the people who drive me crazy. <br>
                          The people who just… argh, ruin absolutely everything goddammit and make me lose matches all the time. <br>
                        
                        I really need to play less Rocket League. This is not good for my blood pressure. <br>
                        
                        So, just to get it all out of my system I wanted to do this. <br>
                         I wanted to create this comprehensive list. These are the Rocket League people who are the worst. <br>
                          The absolute worst. <br>
                        
                        People Who Rush The Ball At Kick Off No Matter What <br>
                        
                        These people are first on the list forever. <br>
                        
                        Okay. You start the match. You have an awkward spawn. <br>
                         The one when you’re all the way at the back. <br>
                          NEWSFLASH: you are not going to get to the ball before a player on the opposing team. <br>
                           YOU ARE JUST NOT. Hang back! Relax. Play the goalkeeper, get ready for a rebound! <br>
                        
                        Anything’s better that herp-a-derp let’s all run towards the ball together hurray! I ALMOST GOT IT! <br>
                        
                        Crazy idea: just let everyone else know! It’s super easy. <br>
                        At kick off, a simple message. If you have a good spawn: “I got it”. <br> 
                        If you have a spawn at the back: “defending”. How easy is that? <br>
                        
                        I’ve seen it happen so many times, especially in 2v2. <br>
                         Both players rush the ball, you lose a goal. Next time no-one rushes the ball because ‘whoops, <br>
                          I shouldn’t have rushed the ball last time’. COMMUNICATION PEOPLE!</strong></p>
